# QOSF-QML-
My First go at Quantum Machine Learning 

Scratch and raw work is in the scratch notebook, some notes and remarks on the task and my final attempt are attatched to a cleaned up document called QOSF task 2. 

I discuss several attempts on finding gradients of quantum circuits, as well as other remarks about the problem in question as well as things I picked up along the way. 

Special thanks to the mentors and applicants at QOSF for a wonderful opprotunity. 

It was great to develop more robust ability in the growing quantum software space. I can not wait to solve more problems computationally going forward! 

This project was much different than my previous project on quantum phase estimation (check the repo!), working with something like the QFT which is well known and studied
is much different than QML where the literature is not as vast and the examples are few and far between. This is a real challenge for researchers and the answers are not 
out there, you need to be able to synthesize a solution, this was probably the most rewarding part of the task. Not getting a solution as expected can be more interesting 
then getting a 100% expected result, I got to make a bunch of mistakes and broaden my horizons as a result.
