# QOSF-QML-
My First go at Quantum Machine Learning 

Scratch and raw work is in the scratch notebook, some notes and remarks on the task and my final attempt are attatched to a cleaned up document called QOSF task 2. 

I discuss several attempts on finding gradients of quantum circuits, as well as other remarks about the problem in question as well as things I picked up along the way. 

Special thanks to the mentors and applicants at QOSF for a wonderful opprotunity. 

It was great to develop more robust ability in the growing quantum software space. I can not wait to solve more problems computationally going forward!
